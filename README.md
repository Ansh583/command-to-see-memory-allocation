# how does-memory-allocation-in python works;
In python memory allocation is done by the data you store in your variable not the variabele 
in other language like c memory allocation is done by the variable 
for example you have 2 variable.
a=10
and 
b=10
so in c language it will  allocate as  a and b.
But in python language it will store in one location because in python 
the memory allocation is done by the data not the variable.

this is the code to check the memory allocation https://github.com/Ansh583/command-to-see-memory-allocation/blob/main/code%20for%20memory%20allocation%20in%20python
