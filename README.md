# how does-memory-allocation-in python works;
In python memory allocation is done by the data you store in your variable not the variabele 
in other language like c memory allocation is done by the variable 
for example you have 2 variable.
a=10
and 
b=10
so in c language it will  allocate as  a and b.
But in python language it will store in one location because in python 
the memory allocation is done by the data not the variable.
